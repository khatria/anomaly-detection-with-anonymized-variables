# anomaly-detection-with-anonymized-variables
Built a simpe predictive model which can identify a pattern in variables and suggest that a hack is going to happen.
All the countries across the globe have adapted to means of digital payments. And with the increased volume of digital payments, hacking has become a pretty common event. We have data with some anonymized variables. We need to build a predictive model which can identify a pattern in these variables and suggest that a hack is going to happen so that the cyber security can somehow stop it before it actually happens.
# Information about the variables we have:
INCIDENT ID: Unique identifier for an incident
DATE: Date of the incident
X_1 - X_15: Anonymized Logging Parameter
MULTIPLE_OFFENSE: Indicates if incident was a hack or not
